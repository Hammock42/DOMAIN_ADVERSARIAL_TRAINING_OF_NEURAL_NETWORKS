# DOMAIN ADVERSARIAL TRAINING OF NEURAL NETWORKS

This repository contains the implementation of domain adversarial training of neural networks. 

## Introduction

Domain adversarial training is a technique used to improve the robustness and generalization of neural networks by reducing the domain shift between the training and testing data. It involves training a neural network to simultaneously classify the input data and predict the domain of the data. By doing so, the network learns to be invariant to domain-specific features and focuses on learning domain-invariant representations.

## Installation

To use this code, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the domain adversarial neural network, run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

You can modify the training parameters and network architecture in the `config.py` file.

## Results

We have evaluated the performance of the domain adversarial training on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. The results show that the domain adversarial training improves the generalization of the neural network and reduces the domain shift.
